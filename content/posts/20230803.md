I just published on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6153001) my solution to fix my [Shure WH20](https://www.thomann.de/fr/shure_wh20xlr.htm) microphone on my [Beyerdynamic DT 700 PRO X](https://www.thomann.de/fr/beyerdynamic_dt_700_pro_x.htm) headset.

Conception was made in Fusion 360 and printed with my lovely Prusa Mini 3D printer.

Feel free to 3D print it if you're intestered! (STL files on Thingiverse)
