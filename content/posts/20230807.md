It took me a while to publish it, but finally you can find on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6160093) my solution to mount 19 inches rack units under 40-type-I profiles.

I use it to mount two [Behringer EPQ 304](https://www.thomann.de/fr/behringer_epq_304_europower.htm) under my home cockpit, they are used for haptic feedbacks.

On the front side, it's less heavy but still fonctionnal with a [Power distributor](https://www.thomann.de/fr/the_t.racks_power_8_iec_va.htm) and a [25 cm rack adapter](https://www.thomann.de/fr/thon_rackwanne_1he.htm).

Feel free to 3D print it if you're intestered! (STL files on Thingiverse)
