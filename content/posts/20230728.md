By default, cache is limited to 20GB and is located in your user account (%AppData%..\LocalLow\VRChat\vrchat).
It is possible to change the location by following this tutorial: https://help.vrchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500004572821-I-want-to-change-where-my-downloaded-content-cache-is-stored

While we're on it, we can also change cache size by following this documentation: https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/configuration-file

Here is the config.json I use:
```json
{
	"cache_directory": "F:/Cache/VRChat/",
	"cache_size": 100
}
```

(PS: Don't forget to remove the old Cache-WindowsPlayer after updating config.)
